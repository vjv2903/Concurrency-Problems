# Concurrency-Problems
Threading the process and handling threads in concurrency in variuos real world situations.

## Concurrent Quicksort
Quicksort is a Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm. It is one of the most efficient
sorting algorithms and is based on the idea of splitting an array into smaller ones.
The algorithm first picks an element called a pivot and partitions the array into a ​ low
subarray​ , elements smaller than the pivot and a ​ high subarray​ , elements greater
than the pivot. This step is called the partitioning step.
Quicksort algorithm recursively applies the above step to the sub-arrays, resulting in
sorting the array.
In this task, you are given the number of elements in the array N, and the elements
of the array. You are required to sort the numbers using a Concurrent version of
Quicksort algorithm.
### Tasks
  1. Implement a Concurrent version of Quicksort algorithm
  2. Implement a variant of Concurrent Quicksort algorithm, which uses threads 
  instead of processes.
  3. Comparing the performance of this variant of the algorithm with the ones 
  implemented as a part of the above mentioned tasks.

## Automating Biryani Serving
The line for serving Biryani is growing day by day in the Kadamb Mess. Annoyed by
waiting for hours in the queue you have decided to automate the entire pipeline of
serving Biryani.
### Infrastructure
#### Robot Chefs
● From now on, there will be​ M Robot Chefs ​ present in the kitchen preparing
vessels of Biryani.


● Each Robot Chef can prepare a random number (greater than or equal to 1)
of Biryani vessels at a time.

● Each Biryani vessel has a capacity to serve ​ P Students​ .
#### Serving Tables
● There will be​ N Serving Tables​ present in the mess.

● Each Serving Table has a ​ Serving Container​ which loads a Biryani vessel
prepared by any of our Robot Chefs. Only one vessel of Biryani can be loaded
at a time into the Serving Container. The Serving Container can be refilled
only when it is empty.

● The Serving Table incorporates the latest state of the art technologies and
has automated the process of serving Biryani through multiple slots available
on it.

● As long as a serving table has enough portions of Biryani left in the serving
container, it makes a random number of slots available for the students to
collect a portion of Biryani from the Serving Table. Note that the number of
slots should always be less than or equal to the portions left in the Serving
Container. Read down for exact limits.

● Thus there is a possibility that once a Serving Table has ​ x ​ available slots and
later has greater than ​ x ​ or less than ​ x ​ slots available. After serving ​ x ​ portions
(and consequently ​ x ​ students) the portions available in the Serving Container
is updated.
#### Student
● K Students ​ have registered for the Biryani.
### Pipeline
#### Robot Chef
● Each Robot chef takes ​ w seconds ​ (random between 2-5) to prepare ​ r
vessels ​ (random between 1-10)​ ​ of biryani at any particular time. Each vessel
has a capacity to feed ​ p students ​ (random between 25-50).

● Once the Robot Chef is done preparing the Biryani Vessels, he invokes the
function biryani_ready() and does not return from it until all the biryani vessels
he has cooked are loaded into any of the serving containers.

● Once all the biryani vessels are empty, the biryani_ready() function returns
and the Robot Chef resumes making another batch of Biryani.
#### Serving Tables
● Each Serving table’s serving container is initially empty. It waits for any of the
Robot Chefs to load a vessel of Biryani into the serving container. The serving
table cannot go into serving mode as long as its container is empty.

● Once the serving container is full, it enters into the serving mode. It invokes a
function ready_to_serve_table(int number_of_slots) in which number_of_slots
(chosen randomly between 1-10) denotes the number of slots available at the
particular serving table at that instant. The function must not return until either
all the serving slots of the serving table are full or all the waiting students have
been assigned a slot. Note that student can be assigned a slot at any of the
serving tables. (If there is no waiting student, then the function returns)
#### Students
● Once a student arrives in the mess, he/she invokes a function wait_for_slot().
This function does not return until a Serving table with a free slot is available,
that is ready_to_serve_table method is in progress. Once the function returns
the students goes to the allocated slot and waits for the slot to serve Biryani.

● Once the student is in the slot, he/she will call the function student_in_slot() to
let the Serving Table know that he/she has arrived at the slot.

● Once all the students have been served you are done for the day.
To convince the Mess Committee you have decided to build a simulation of your
efficient serving pipeline.
### Instructions
● Each Robot Chef, Serving Table and Student are threads.

● Stop the simulation when all the students are served.

● A Serving Table is used multiple times for serving. That means if there are still
students left to be served, the serving table should invoke
ready_to_serve_table().

● Use appropriate small delays for the simulation.

● The use of semaphores is not allowed. You can use only one mutex lock per
Serving Table and Robot Chef.

● Your simulation should allow for multiple students to arrive at a Serving Table
simultaneously. It must be possible for several students to have called
wait_for_slot() function and the wait_for_slot function returned for each of the
student before any of the student calling student_in_slot function

● Your simulation must not result in dead-locks.

● You are allowed to declare more functions if you require.
The goal of this problem is for you to appreciate the use of threads and
synchronisation techniques. There are no strict restrictions on the output format, as
long as the simulation functions smoothly and displays appropriate messages.

## Ober Cab Services
Ober is a new cab service, which needs your help to implement the simple system.
The requirements of the system are as follows given N cabs, M riders and K
payment servers you need to implement a working system which ensures
correctness and idempotency. Each cab has one driver. In Ober, payments by the
riders should be done in Payment Servers only. Ober provides two types of cab
services namely pool and premier ride. In pool ride maximum of two riders can sharea cab whereas in premier ride only one rider. There are four states for a cab namely
waitState ​ (no rider in cab), ​ onRidePremier​ , ​ onRidePoolFull ​ (pool ride with two
riders), ​ onRidePoolOne​ (pool ride with only one rider).
As a part of this system you need to implement the following functionalities.
  1. Riders​ :
    
    a. BookCab: This function takes three inputs namely ​ cabType ​ ,
    maxWaitTime , ​ ​ RideTime ​ . If the rider doesn’t find any cab (all cabs are
    in usage) until ​ maxWaitTime ​ he exits from the system with ​ TimeOut
    message.
    
    b. MakePayment: This function should be called by rider only after the
    end of the ride. If all the K payment servers are busy, then the rider
    should wait for the payment servers to get free. After payment is done
    rider can exit from the system.
  2. Drivers​ :
    
    a. AcceptRide: If ride is premier cab in ​ waitState ​ should accept ride and
    change its state to ​ onRidePremier . ​ If the ride is pool and there is a cab
    with state ​ onRidePoolOne ​ then that cab should accept the ride and
    changes its state to ​ onRidePoolFull ​ . If the ride is pool and there is no
    cab with the state ​ onRidePoolOne ​ then cab in wait state should accept
    ride and change its state to ​ onRidePoolOne . ​ Assume that there is no
    time gap between accept rider and pickup rider, i.e., ride starts
    immediately after accepting ride. If there are multiple cabs available
    with required state take any random cab.
    
    b. OnRide: When pool cab is on ride and state is ​ onRidePoolOne ​ then
    driver can accept another pool ride. No new rider is accepted when cab
    is on premier ride.
    
    c. EndRide: The driver ends the ride after completion of the ​ RideTime ​ of
    the rider. If the ride is a premier it goes to ​ waitState ​ (ready to accept
    new rides) once ride is done. If cab’s state is ​ onRidePoolOne ​ then
    driver ends the ride and goes to ​ waitState . ​ If cab’s state is
    onRidePoolFull ​ then it goes to ​ onRidePoolOne ​ state (Notably, it can
    accept another pool rider). Driver or cab need not wait for the payment
    to be done by the rider.
  3. Payment Servers:
    
    a. Accept payment: Payment servers accepts a payment and assume the
    payment time is constant for all the riders.
